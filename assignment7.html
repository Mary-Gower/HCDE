            The Goal: Mix hydrostone and use the molds to creaet a plaster cast of the shape.

            Tools Used: Hydrostone, water, disposable cups, small plastic mixing spoon, timer.

      	   Both prints (top and bottom) took approximately 10 hours each to 3D print. I then took the Oomoo 30 and combined 1 cup the pink mixture and one cup of the blue mixture to create the purple silicone mold to pour into the printed mold. I left one mold to cure for 6 hours and another to cure overnight. The one I left to cure overnight was significantly harder to release. I also was instructed that I may need sprues for my molds and I constructed those in the 3D printed mold before doing the Oomoo cast using small wooden sticks

            Next I set up a station to cast hydrostone in my mold. I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup and cardboard disposable cups to make the mixure, following package directions and using 3 parts hydrostone to 1 part water.

I left each cast in for over an hour to dry because the structure of my design was a little bit delicate. If I were to create this mold again I would design a sturdier, more solid object. The first mold that I cast broke when I was trying to release it from the silicone. I spent much more time delicately releasing the remaining objects and I did a total of five casts.</p>
