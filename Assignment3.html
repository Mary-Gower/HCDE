            The Goal: Assemble and level 3D printer and create (in Rhino), slice (in Cura) a series of objects to print, including a nested set of objects.
            </p>

            Tools Used: Illustrator, Rhino, Calipers, Filament, 3D Printer, many YouTube tutorials on how to print things on an Ender3 Pro

            I began by setting up the printer following the instructions included with the model. The printer is a Creality Ender3 Pro and took approximately 2.5 hours to assemble. After assembly I loaded the filament and got to work leveling the bed. For this I used the instuctions found on Thingiverse here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3235018 along with the YouTube video linked therein. This process was very tedious and took approximately 45 minutes of adjusting. I also had to change the Z height in order to make the glass plate fit onto the bed.

            <p>
      	    I printed the following test prints, creating a cube in rhino and exporting it as an STL into Cura and then using the microSD chip to transfer the file to the Ender3 Pro. I used the same process for all of the prints that I made. </p>
<p>
A 2cm cube with the standard "low quality" settings (25 minutes to print)
A 2cm cube with the standard "standard quality" settings (25 minutes to print)
A 2cm cube with the standard "super quality" settings (50 minutes to print)
	 </p>
            <p>

            </p>
	    <p>
            I then printed a 2 cm cube with a concentric top and bottom layer and with the "super quality" setting as that was the setting that I liked the most in the test prints. Time to print for that was 46 minutes.
        </p>

            </p>
	    <p>
            My settings were placed at 200 degrees for the nozzle and the bed was set to 65 degrees fahrenheit.

           Finally, I printed the following items and here are their print times:
            </p>
 <p>
A tube 3cm in diameter and 3cm high with a single extrusion wall thickness (20 minutes to print)
A tube 3cm in diameter and 3cm high with a double extrusion wall thickness and random z-seam alignment (24 minutes to print)
A cylinder 3cm in diameter exported with a 0.1mm tolerance (44 minutes to print)
A cylinder 3cm in diameter exported with a 0.001mm tolerance (42 minutes to print)
A cylinder 3cm in diameter with special mode "spiralize outer contour". (44 minutes to print)
A cylinder 3cm in diameter printed on its side with supports on. (50 minutes to print)
