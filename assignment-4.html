            The Goal: Create and print in the Mill or with a 3D printer a tightly joined box that connects without the aid of glue or other adhesives.

            Tools Used: Rhino, Calipers, Filament, 3D Printer, more YouTube tutorials on how to print things on an Ender3 Pro, lots of patience.

            I tried a few different methods when making the box to print. I knew I had been struggling with 3D printing and understanding how to create geometry in Rhino that would print well. I also know that more complex assignments are on the horizon and I wanted to learn more and gain better skills with these tools. I first tried to make a box by joining multiple solid box objects together in a 3D plane and using the UnionBoolean command to group the pieces that I wanted to print. That proved to be more complicated than I anticipated and my first print was not successful. I spoke with classmates Akshay Rawat and Rodrigo Tarribia to ask their advice and realized the method of drawing the shape in 2d and then extruding it, capping it, and exporting it as I had done for previous assignments would be best. Time to print: 50 minutes

      	   My first test print was a failure and I had to go back to the drawing board and redesign the model. I also wanted to avoide bed plate adhesion which has been problematic for past prints and I tried to print the box pieces sitting vertically. This resulted in the biggest failure when one of the pieces fell over. In hindsight, one way to fix this could have been to use supports.  </p>

            <h2>Second Print</h2>
	    <p>
           All of my designs were made in rhino and then exported as an STL into Cura and then using the microSD chip I transfered the file to the Ender3 Pro. Time to print for the first print was 1 hour and 20 minutes. The first measurements of the joints of the cube were too small and I found the same to be true for the second round of measurements. When I consulted a friend, I was told that perhaps it was the wall thickness that I had set in Cura and that if I adust that and the infill I may be able to print faster and with more accurate prints.

            My settings were placed at 200 degrees for the nozzle and the bed was set to 60 degrees fahrenheit.

           The time for the second print was 3hrs and 14 minutes. Unfortunately this next print was not able to combine into a box. When I measured the pieces, I noted that the parts were that should fit togethere were measuring off from what I had designed them to be in Rhino. I will adjust them slightly and the printer settings for the next print to get a box that will fully close and latch together.

		I finally was able to print pieces that would lock together and hold after changing the dimensions of the original Rhino file and moving the points of the interlocking joints over by .4mm in both directions to make the joints bigger. This was a number that I got from the difference between the sice of the original pegs and indents from my first print. I also set the tolerance to .1.
