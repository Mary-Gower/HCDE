            Hello! My name is Mary Gower and I am a former preschool teacher turned product designer for an Ed Tech company. I'm a second year HCDE Masters student and very interested in quality product design in education and responsible game design for children. I am excited gain experience with CAD software and become more comfortable with GitHub (I find it very confusing to use but I'm learning!). I look forward to contributing an understanding of Illustrator and bringing my skills as a designer and positive attitude to the class!
