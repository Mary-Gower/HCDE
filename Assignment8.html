            For my final project, I want to make a sensory box appropriate for a child between the ages of 3 and 5 to practice play with manipulative toys and improve fine motor skills.

            <p>
      	    I decided to create a box that could accommodate mini playdough containters, cookie-cutter style manupulatives, and a removeable divider that acts as an additional tool for play. The box will close with a lid that can slide on for a secure fit and can also act as a tray for the child to play with the playdough on. In order to make the cookie-cutter manipulatives I will follow a <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=libPPCl_S0U&ab_channel=APdesign">tutorial</a> and create unique shapes with Grasshopper. 
            </p>
             <p>
            <h2>Tasks & Techniques</h2>
				   </p>
            <p>
      	    Techniques I will use include: Modeling in Rhino, Parametric Modeling with Grasshopper, Slicing with Cura, 3D Printing. 
            </p>
            <p>
            1. Modeling the Box, Lid, & Divider in Rhino: Using Rhino, I will model the three parts of the box: the main body, the top, and the divider that also functions as a manipulative tool for fine motor skills development. 
             </p>
            <p>
            2. 3D Printing the Box, Lid, & Divider: Once the parts are modeled, I will do a small test print to check the fit of the lid and then I will print the full scale version.
             </p>
            <p>
            3. Modeling the Cookie Cutters with Grasshopper: While I am modeling the Box, Lid, & Divider I will utilize Grasshopper to additionally model an organizer for the casted objects. This organizer will fit into the storage box.
             </p>
            <p>
            4. Making Adjustments to the 3D Printed Parts: Based on the test print and how things fit, make adjustments to the box, lid, and divider.
             </p>
            <p>
            5. Printing the Final Box & Cookie Cutters: Once I have tested the fit and made adjustments to parts in Rhino and Grasshopper, I will do the final 3D prints.
             </p>
            <p>
            6. Finishing Touches: To make it a little more festive, I will add non-toxic, kid safe gold paint to the top of the lid around the letters.
             </p>
            <p>
            7. Assembly and Documentation: Finally I will assemble the final product and document my experience.
 </p>
            <p>
  <h2>Timeline</h2>
